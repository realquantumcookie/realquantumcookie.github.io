### Hello, World!

I am an undergraduate student at University of California, Berkeley, studying computer science. My research interest is mainly in applying machine learning for robotics control.

I am fortunate enough to be affiliated with [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) lab as an undergraduate research assistant, working with Phd [Laura Smith](https://lauramsmith.github.io) and advised by prof. [Sergey Levine](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/).

I am also a member of [Robot Open Autonomous Racing(ROAR)](https://roar.berkeley.edu/) team, advised by prof. [Allen Yang](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yang/) where I am working on developing RL and CV algorithms for autonomous racing.

My hobbies are playing piano, hiphop dancing, playing tennis, and playing League of Legends :)

In my spare time, I also write open-source softwares and produce educational videos with my group of friends @ [InteractivePlus](https://interactiveplus.org/).
